Welcome to Tundra
A small portable class library which aids in the implementation of the MVVM architectural pattern. This library can be used in any XAML based application. Please take into consideration that Tundra is not intended to replace MVVM Light, merely to extend the functionality based on previous implementation that I did. Please refer to the Wiki for more information: Wiki

Introduction

Tundra is a small portable class library written in C# .NET, which aids in the implementation of MVVM. It extends the implementation done by MVVM Light. As mentioned previously, this assembly can be used and implemented in any XAML based application. The source code submitted will consist of the following XAML based applications:

WinRT aka Windows Store Application
WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
Windows Phone 8.1
Tundra addresses, amongst other the following categories within MVVM:

Bootstrapping
Commanding
Extensions
Messaging
MVVM Base Class Implementation
View Model Locators
Wrapper and Providers
Tundra relies on the following frameworks:

Lex.Db: Lex.DB is a lightweight, superfast, in-process database engine
Microsoft.Bcl: Microsoft BCL Portability Pack
Microsoft.Bcl.Async: This package enables 'async' and 'await' keywords
Microsoft.Bcl.Build: provides build infrastructure components
MvvmCross: MVVM bindings - Hot Tuna MvvmCross Libraries
MvvmLightLibs: MVVM bindings - MVVM Light libraries
Newtonsoft.Json: son.NET is a popular high-performance JSON framework
Portable.Ninject: dependency injection framework
