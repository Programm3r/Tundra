# Welcome to Tundra
A small portable class library which aids in the implementation of the MVVM architectural pattern. This library can be used in any XAML based application.

## Introduction
Tundra is a small portable class library written in C# .NET, which aids in the implementation of MVVM. It extends the implementation done by MVVM Light. As mentioned previously, this assembly can be used and implemented in any XAML based application. The source code submitted will consist of the following XAML based applications:

  * WinRT aka Windows Store Application
  * WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
  * Windows Phone 8.1

Tundra addresses, amongst other the following categories within MVVM:

  * Bootstrapping
  * Commanding
